# * IN DEVELOPMENT * Jaqsen's Portfolio - Challenge Week 2 * IN DEVELOPMENT *

## Description

This webpage demonstrates my work during our Challenge Week 2 assignment which was centered around creating a portfolio page using HTML and CSS. This was my first Challenge Assignment beginning with zero starter code. The objective was to create a portfolio layout in compliance with the given Acceptance Criteria. 

## Why Build a Portfolio?

One thing that attracted me to the University of Minnesota's coding bootcamp was the focus on getting students career ready and in a position to be hired as quickly and smoothly as possible. My instructional team knows that in the real world it's important as a Dev that I have a complete and accessible portfolio online to share with potential employer's and contacts as I network within the coding community. Though this portfolio, in its current state, is basic and in-development - it will one day evolve into a webpage that I rely on for opportunity. With this Challenge the first bricks were laid. 

## What adversity did I face during this Web Portfolio design?

1. Poor Planning - This was my first challenge assignment beginning with zero starter code and I took this for granted. Due to a very busy work schedule and a small amount of procrastination, I didn't begin this Challenge assignment until 2 days before its due date. I now understand that this bootcamp moves extremely fast and time must be managed accordingly. For future challenges I will begin right away and block off consistent time chunks throughout the week to return to my work with a fresh mind. Coding is complex and inevitably problems and bugs arise, and I feel that it's important to have several chunks of time set aside to work on my code with breaks in between to reset my mind and approach.

2. Flexbox Manipulation - Even though I waited until the last couple of days to work on this Portfolio I still spent close to 10-15 hours working on it. The number one time sink that I couldn't figure out and am still testing and playing around with is the ```Display:flex;``` property. Mentally, I am still working to understand the parent/child relationship and how to properly assign these items to manipualte them in correspondance to one another. Most of the time I spent on this Portfolio was making adjustments to flex properties in an attempt to arrange the page similarly to our demonstration. Ultimately, I still haven't found the right formula, but I am proud of my progress and intend on continuing to make improvements even after turning the assignment in. 

3. Unable to attempt @media query for mobile devices. Due to the amount of time I spent manipulating flex properties unsuccessfully, I ran out of time to attempt to add @media queries.
